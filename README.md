## Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal
### https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-postorder-traversal

Return any binary tree that matches the given preorder and postorder traversals.

Values in the traversals pre and post are distinct positive integers.
```
Example 1:

Input: pre = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7], post = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
``` 

**Note:**
1. 1 <= pre.length == post.length <= 30
2. pre[] and post[] are both permutations of 1, 2, ..., pre.length.
3. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there exists multiple answers, you can return any of them.

## Thoughts 

We can construct a unique binary tree from inorder and preorder sequences, as well as from the inorder and postorder sequences. 
But preorder and postorder sequences donâ€™t provide enough information to create a unique binary tree. 
More than one binary trees can be constructed due to ambiguity.

```
              a             a         
             /               \
            b                 b 
           /                   \
          c                     c
 Left Skewed Tree            Right Skewed Tree 
```
For both left skewed tree and right skewed tree, the preorder and postorder traversal results in same sequence.

```
Preorder  [a, b, c]
Postorder [c, b, a]
```
Therefore, its not possible to construct a unique binary tree with the help of preorder and postoder sequences. 
However we can construct a unique full binary tree using the Preorder and Postorder traversal.
